> Complete conversation log between the developer and GitHub Copilot  
> during the step-by-step creation of the Arkanoid game.

---

## Session Start

**Environment:** Microsoft Visual Studio Enterprise 2026  
**Workspace:** `C:\Users\c.rooster\source\repos\TestCopilot\`  
**Starting state:** Empty workspace

---

## Interaction 1 — Initial Request

**User:**
> Can you make a game in web

**Copilot:**
- Checked workspace structure (empty)
- Proposed a Snake game as a starting point
- Created initial project scaffolding

---

## Interaction 2 — Pivoting to Physics

**User:**
> I would like to make a game with physics engine in web. And make it in steps. First step which physics engine available

**Copilot:**
- Presented a comparison of 2D engines (Matter.js, Planck.js, Box2D.js, p2.js)
- Presented a comparison of 3D engines (Cannon.js, Ammo.js, Rapier.js, Oimo.js)
- Listed game frameworks with built-in physics (Phaser, Babylon.js, Three.js)
- Recommended Matter.js for 2D, Cannon-es + Three.js for 3D, Rapier.js for performance
- Asked user to choose game type

---

## Interaction 3 — Choosing Arkanoid

**User:**
> a physics engine for 2d game like arkanooid?

**Copilot:**
- Recommended **Matter.js** as the best fit for Arkanoid
- Explained why: built-in restitution, easy collision detection, simple API, CDN support
- Compared alternatives (Planck.js — overkill, p2.js — less maintained, Phaser — heavier)
- Outlined a 6-step build plan:
  1. Project setup + Matter.js + canvas
  2. Walls + ball with physics
  3. Paddle with mouse/keyboard
  4. Brick grid + destruction
  5. Score, lives, game over/win
  6. Polish — sounds, colors, power-ups

---

## Interaction 4 — Step 1: Engine Setup

**User:**
> yes proceed

**Copilot created:**
- `index.html` — Dark theme, 480×640 canvas, Matter.js CDN
- `game.js` — Engine with zero gravity, 3 walls, ball with perfect bounce, speed normalization

**Technical details:**
- `restitution: 1`, `friction: 0`, `frictionAir: 0`, `inertia: Infinity`
- `beforeUpdate` event normalizes ball speed every frame
- Random launch angle between -45° and -15°

---

## Interaction 5 — Step 2: Paddle

**User confirmed Step 1 working.**

**Copilot added:**
- Paddle body (`isStatic: true`, chamfered corners)
- Mouse control (`mousemove` → set paddle X)
- Keyboard control (arrow keys, A/D with `PADDLE_SPEED = 8`)
- Paddle clamped within walls
- Angle-based paddle bounce (hit position → -60° to +60°)

---

## Interaction 6 — Step 3: Bricks

**User confirmed Step 2 working.**

**Copilot added:**
- `createBricks()` function — 6 rows × 10 columns
- Color-coded rows: red, red, orange, orange, green, green
- `collisionStart` handler detects ball + brick collisions
- `Composite.remove()` destroys bricks on hit
- `bricks[]` array tracks remaining bricks

---

## Interaction 7 — Step 4: Score & Lives

**User confirmed Step 3 working.**

**Copilot added:**
- Score system: red = 50pts, orange = 30pts, green = 10pts
- `brickRow` property stored on each brick for scoring
- 3 lives with heart symbols (❤) in HUD
- Ball out-of-bounds detection in `beforeUpdate`
- `resetBall()` with 500ms delay before re-launch
- Game Over overlay (red text, dark background)
- You Win overlay (green text)
- SPACE to restart — `restartGame()` resets all state
- `afterRender` event draws HUD over Matter.js rendering

---

## Interaction 8 — Step 5: Polish

**User confirmed Step 4 working.**

**Copilot added:**
- **Particle system:** `spawnParticles()`, `updateParticles()`, `drawParticles()`
- **Ball trail:** Position history array, fading circles
- **Ball glow:** `visible: false` on Matter.js body, custom draw with `shadowBlur`
- **Paddle color:** Changed to cyan (`#4cc9f0`)
- **Canvas glow:** CSS `box-shadow` with red glow
- **Sound system:** `AudioContext`, `playSound(freq, duration, type)`
  - 7 different sound functions for different events
- Hearts drawn in red (`#e94560`)

---

## Interaction 9 — AudioContext Bug

**User:**
> can we fix this: The AudioContext was not allowed to start. It must be resumed (or created) after a user gesture on the page.

**Copilot fixed:**
- Changed `const audioCtx = new AudioContext()` to lazy `getAudioCtx()`
- `getAudioCtx()` creates on first call, resumes if suspended

---

## Interaction 10 — AudioContext Bug (Still Happening)

**User:**
> still issue — The AudioContext was not allowed to start

**Copilot root cause:** Ball was launched immediately on page load, hitting things before user gesture.

**Copilot fixed:**
- Added `gameStarted` flag — ball stays stationary until user interacts
- Added `startGame()` function called on first click/keypress
- `startGame()` calls `getAudioCtx()` to warm up audio
- Added "ARKANOID" title screen with "Click or press any key to start"
- Guards on `beforeUpdate` and `collisionStart` check `gameStarted`
- Restart resets `gameStarted = false` to show title screen again

---

## Interaction 11 — Power-Ups

**User:**
> can we add some power ups?

**Copilot added 4 power-up types:**

| Type | Symbol | Color | Effect |
|------|--------|-------|--------|
| Wide | W | Cyan | Paddle 1.5× wider, 8s |
| Life | + | Green | +1 life (max 5) |
| Multi | M | Orange | 2 extra balls |
| Slow | S | Purple | 60% ball speed, 8s |

**Implementation details:**
- 25% drop chance per brick
- Canvas-drawn falling objects (not physics bodies)
- AABB collision with paddle for collection
- `resizePaddle()` using `Body.setVertices()`
- Extra balls as full physics bodies
- `currentBallSpeed` and `currentPaddleWidth` variables
- Timed effects with `setTimeout` and `activePowerupTimers[]`
- HUD indicators: `[W]`, `[S]`, `[M]x2`
- `resetPowerups()` clears everything on restart
- Power-up collection sound (880Hz sine)

---

## Interaction 12 — Multiple Levels

**User:**
> add multiple game levels

**Copilot added 5 levels:**

| # | Name | Speed | Brick Count |
|---|------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | CLASSIC | 1.0× | 60 |
| 2 | DIAMOND | 1.1× | 30 |
| 3 | FORTRESS | 1.2× | 40 |
| 4 | ZIGZAG | 1.35× | 32 |
| 5 | FINAL WALL | 1.5× | 76 |

**Implementation details:**
- `LEVELS[]` array with name, speed multiplier, and grid pattern strings
- `BRICK_DEFS` object maps letters to colors/points (6 types: R, O, G, B, P, Y)
- `createBricksForLevel(index)` parses grid strings
- `getLevelSpeed()` returns `BALL_SPEED * level.speed`
- Level complete → 2s "LEVEL COMPLETE!" overlay → `advanceLevel()`
- Final level cleared → "YOU WIN! All 5 levels cleared!"
- HUD shows `LVL N - NAME` at center
- Start screen shows level name before each level
- Score/lives carry between levels, power-ups reset
- Level-complete sound (ascending arpeggio)

---

## Interaction 13 — Paddle Snapping Bug

**User:**
> when using key arrows the paddle moves to the right when releasing. Leave the paddle where it is.

**Copilot diagnosed:** On key release, no keys pressed → code fell through to `paddleX = mouseX`, snapping to mouse position (default center or last mouse position).

**Copilot fixed:**
- Added `inputMode` variable: `"mouse"` or `"keyboard"`
- `keydown` on arrow/WASD → `inputMode = "keyboard"`
- `mousemove` → `inputMode = "mouse"`
- Game loop: keyboard mode = only move with keys; mouse mode = follow cursor
- No fallback between modes — paddle stays put on key release

---

## Interaction 14 — Pause Feature

**User:**
> can we add a pause command

**Copilot added:**
- `gamePaused` flag + `savedVelocities` object
- **ESC** or **P** key toggles pause
- `pauseGame()`: saves ball/extra ball velocities, zeroes them
- `resumeGame()`: restores saved velocities
- Guards on `beforeUpdate`, `collisionStart` skip when paused
- Dark overlay with "PAUSED" and "Press ESC or P to resume"
- `gamePaused = false` on restart

---

## Interaction 15 — Ball Sliding Along Walls

**User:**
> sometimes when the ball hits the wall it doesn't calculate the correct angle of collision I think. The ball keeps sliding inline with the wall

**Copilot diagnosed:** Matter.js collision resolution at shallow angles can produce near-zero bounce.

**Copilot fixed:**
- Added `normalizeBall(b)` function
- Called every frame in `beforeUpdate` for main ball + extra balls
- Computes angle via `Math.atan2(|vy|, |vx|)`
- If angle < 20° from horizontal → nudge vertical component
- If angle > 70° from horizontal → nudge horizontal component
- Re-normalizes to `currentBallSpeed`
- `MIN_ANGLE = Math.PI / 9` (20°)

---

## Interaction 16 — Mobile/Touch Support

**User:**
> will this also have mobile support?

**Copilot added full touch support:**

**HTML changes:**
- `maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no` on viewport meta
- `touch-action: none` on game canvas
- `#pauseBtn` — on-screen pause button (visible only on touch devices)
- `#gameContainer` wrapper for relative positioning

**JS changes:**
- `touchstart` → tap to start, tap to restart
- `touchmove` → paddle follows finger (mapped from scaled coords)
- `inputMode = "touch"` added as third mode
- `scaleCanvas()` — auto-scales canvas to fit viewport, runs on resize
- `pauseBtn` click toggles pause, icon switches ⏸ ↔ ▶
- `{ passive: false }` on touch listeners to `preventDefault()` scrolling
- Mouse coordinate mapping updated to account for canvas scaling
- All overlay text updated: "Tap, click, or press any key"

---

## Interaction 17 — Graphics Upgrade

**User:**
> can we upgrade the graphics?

**Copilot added:**

**New rendering functions:**
- `drawGradientBricks(ctx)` — Linear gradient fill + top shine strip + animated shimmer wave
- `drawGradientPaddle(ctx)` — 3-tone gradient + outer glow + top shine line
- `drawBallGlow(ctx, b, color, glowColor)` — Radial glow aura + specular highlight dot

**Upgraded systems:**
- `BRICK_DEFS` expanded with `highlight` color per type
- Particles: circles + directional spark streaks + gravity (`vy += 0.08`)
- Ball trail: cyan radial gradient instead of flat white
- All Matter.js default rendering disabled (`visible: false`)

**New effects:**
- Starfield: 80 twinkling stars drifting downward
- Screen shake: `triggerShake(intensity)`, applied via `ctx.translate()` in `afterRender`
- Floating score popups: `spawnScorePopup()` — "+50" rises from bricks
- HUD glow: `shadowColor` + `shadowBlur` on score, level, hearts text

**Brick destruction now triggers:**
- 14 particles (up from 10)
- Score popup
- Screen shake (intensity 3)

**Paddle hit now triggers:**
- 8 particles (up from 6)
- Screen shake (intensity 1.5)

## Interaction 18 — Intro Splash Screen

**User:**
> can we add an intro video "developed by Jekko" with a nice graphical logo

**Copilot created `intro.js`:**

Self-contained IIFE with canvas-based cinematic animation:

**Timeline (4.5 seconds total):**
- 0–20%: Fade in background, particles, accent line
- 10–30%: "developed by" text fades in, "JEKKO" letters reveal one by one
- Each letter spawns 8 cyan/purple sparks
- 20–75%: Full display hold — orbiting particles, pulsing ring, shimmer
- 75–100%: Fade out everything
- 30%+: "tap to skip" hint fades in

**Visual elements:**
- Dark radial gradient background
- 40 floating cyan dots drifting upward
- "developed by" — 14px gray Segoe UI
- "JEKKO" — 64px bold, per-letter gradient (white → cyan → purple)
- Per-letter glow (`shadowBlur: 20`, cyan)
- Per-letter staggered scale animation (0.7 → 1.0)
- 60 orbiting particles in elliptical paths (hue 200–360)
- Horizontal gradient accent line beneath logo
- Pulsing cyan ring around logo
- Letter sparks with gravity

**Interaction:**
- Click/tap anywhere → `finishIntro()` (skip)
- Auto-finishes after 4.5s
- CSS `fade-out` animation (0.8s), then overlay DOM removed

**HTML changes:**
- `#introOverlay` div with `#introCanvas` layered over game
- `z-index: 100`, fixed position, fullscreen
- CSS `@keyframes introFadeOut`
- `intro.js` loaded before `game.js`
